                           Shopping Cart

Create a shopping cart with the following basic functionality:

• Display the list of items available in the store, along with the corresponding quantities currently in stock and the cost per item.

• Ask the customer to enter the number of quantities required for each item.

• Display a message if the item is out of stock. • Accept customer name and delivery address as the input.

•Calculate delivery charges based on the distance of the delivery address from the store, as shown below:
           
             •$10 for up to 5 miles
             
             •$12 between 5-10 miles
             
             •$14 between 10-15 miles
             
             •$20 for beyond 15 miles

• Display the final bill with the items purchased and the customer details.


• The program should keep running in an infinite loop and prompt the user to enter "yes" to continue and enter "no" to terminate the program.

• The items sold to a customer must automatically be updated to display the correct stock levels to the next customer.
